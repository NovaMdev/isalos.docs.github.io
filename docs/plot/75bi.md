# Business Intelligence
{: .no_toc }

Business intelligence is about turning raw data into clear, meaningful insights. It helps reveal patterns, highlight trends, and support more confident, data‑driven decisions. 

The  `Business intelligence` menu provides a dedicated space for building a customizable dashboard. It enables the inclusion of labels and all available charts. These elements can be freely resized and repositioned throughout the dashboard.

## Manipulate Dashboard

The Isalos dashboard is fully editable, allowing each element to be repositioned through drag‑and‑drop interaction and resized by adjusting its corner handles.

To edit the dashboard, the Lock Dashboard checkbox must be disabled, from the dashboard top ribbon:

| Manipulate $$\rightarrow$$ Lock Dashboard |

To control how elements are displayed on the dashboard, the Fit to Window checkbox and Fit to Canvas button provide quick layout adjustments that adapt the view to the available space.

The Fit to Window option automatically scales and repositions all dashboard elements so that the entire layout fits within the current dashboard window. This ensures that users can view the full dashboard without scrolling, with every component resized proportionally. 

The Fit to Canvas expands elements to make optimal use of the available canvas space. It enlarges components as much as possible while maintaining their relative layout and avoiding overlap when possible, resulting in a fuller, more spacious presentation of the dashboard content.

| Manipulate $$\rightarrow$$ Fit to Window |
| Manipulate $$\rightarrow$$ Fit to Canvas |

The above manipulation options can be found in the top dasbhoard ribbon under Manipulate
