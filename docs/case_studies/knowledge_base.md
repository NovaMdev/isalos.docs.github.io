# Case Studies
This section presents representative case studies demonstrating the application of the **Isalos Analytics Platform** across different analytical domains. Each case study is accompanied by:
 
- a **Manual User Guide report**, providing a detailed, step-by-step description of the methodology and results, and  
- the corresponding **Isalos workflow file**, enabling full reproducibility and hands-on execution of the analysis within the platform.
 
The case studies collectively illustrate best practices for data preparation, statistical analysis, and machine learning model development using Isalos.
